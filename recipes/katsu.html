            <caption>A bowl of chicken katsu.</caption>
        <p>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch thickness</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
        </ol>
